PRIVMSG <nick|channel> :message

PRIVMSG will send a standard message to the
user or channel specified.

Two other targets are permitted:

$$servermask - Send a message to a server or set of
               servers
$#hostmask   - Send a message to users matching the
               hostmask specified.

These two are operator only.

The nick can be extended to fit into the following
syntax:

username[%hostname]@servername

This syntax (without the hostname) is used to securely
send a message to a service or a bot.

An extension of this is the syntax to send to all opers
on a server.

opers@servername

In Hybrid 7, all opers on a server will see a message that
looks like a modified WALLOPS
