    1. Configure (see below under CONFIGURE OPTIONS for more details):
+     
+     * IMPORTANT:
+     * At a minimum, you really ought to use the --prefix=/some/place option.
+     * By default, configure will select /usr/local/ircd -- YOU DO *NOT* WANT THAT!
+     * You may *NOT* run the ircd as root, and the ircd user needs to be able to write to
+     * it's own directories. You have been warned.
