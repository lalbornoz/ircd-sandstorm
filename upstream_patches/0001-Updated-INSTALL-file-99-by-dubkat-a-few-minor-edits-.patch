-   As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses GNU autoconf instead of the old
-   Config script. The Makefile has also been updated to include CFLAGS
-   defines for popular modern OSes.

+   2. Configure (see below under CONFIGURE OPTIONS for more details):
 
-       Run the configure script. It will create include/setup.h and the
-       Makefiles to match your system. In ircd-ratbox, the paths are now handled
-       with the --prefix option to configure, not in config.h.
-       /usr/local/ircd is the default if no prefix is specified.
+     I.   Large networks (with thousands of users):
+          ./configure --prefix=/home/user/ircd
 
-       ./configure --prefix="/usr/local/ircd"

+          ./configure --prefix=/home/user/ircd --enable-small-net
 
-         Note: There are some special optional parameters to the configure
-         script that some admins may wish to use.
+     III. Configure ircd-ratbox for running with minimal resources
+          on a 64bit VPS (Virtual Private Server). This creates a 32bit IRCD
+          which takes up less memory:

+   3. Build:
 
-            --enable-kqueue - Use the superior kqueue(2) system call as
-            opposed to the default poll(2). This is currently only available
-            on FreeBSD 4.1 or higher.

-            option.

+
+          * --enable-openssl - Enable the openssl dependent crypto functions.
             This will allow CHALLENGE to work and encrypted links. On systems
             where the configure script can automatically detect OpenSSL, this
             option is not necessary. If configure cannot find OpenSSL, you
             must specify a path with this option
             (--enable-openssl=/path/to/openssl)
 
-          * 
-
-            --enable-ipv6 - Enable IPv6 support.

-          * 
-
-            --disable-shared-modules - Disable module support. This option is
-            more secure, but reduces a lot of the flexibility in Hybrid 7.
-            This may need to be used on some systems without a working dl
-            library.
+            If you plan on using SSL encrypted client connections, or encrypted
+            links, you may wish to run /path/to/ircd/bin/genssl.sh to generate
+            self-signed certificates.
 
-          * 
+          * --enable-ipv6 - Enable IPv6 support. This should be auto-detected.
 
-            --disable-assert - Disable some of the debugging code. This
-            should be used on all production servers for maximum speed and to

-          * 
+          * --enable-assert - Enable some of the debugging code. This
+            should NOT be used on production servers. Doing so is a performance

+            enables extra code to actually make it useful on your ircd.

-          * 
 
-            --with-maxclients - Sets the maximum number of clients support by
-            the server. Note that this also twiddles the HARD_FDLIMIT_ define
-            so it is no longer necessary to modify include/config.h for this.
-            If HARD_FDLIMIT_ ends up being larger that FD_SETSIZE when using
-            select() for your I/O loop, s_bsd_select.c will refuse to compile
-            (and tell you to use poll instead). Take this error's advice and
-            use --enable-poll or something a bit more efficient. You'll be
-            happier at the end of the day for it.
 
-   3. 
-
-       Look over the "include/config.h" file. This allows you to change the
-       few remaining hard coded options of how the ircd will operate. Most
-       admins will only have to change a few settings. USE_SYSLOG is the only
-       one that most admins will need to edit.
-
-         Note: Note that you must have permission by the sysadmin to send
-         messages to the system log files.
-
-         All other settings in config.h are not necessary to edit.
-
-   4.

-       make should build ircd.

+                                 UPGRADING
+   1. If this is a clean install of ircd-ratbox, you may skip this section.
+   
+   2. Upgrading from ircd-ratbox-2.x, ircd-hybrid-7.x
 
-       make install will install the server, modules(1), and tools in the
-       path defined in config.h and the prefix specified when configure was
-       run.
+      If you have an older version of ircd-ratbox or ircd-hybrid, and you have
+      klines, dlines, resvs, and xline config files, keep reading. ircd-ratbox 
+      no longer uses flat-file based configs for these types of entries, instead 
+      they are stored in a database. To prevent accidental clobbering, or leaving 
+      behind old, unsupported modules it would be best to install ratbox into 
+      a clean location.
 
-       (1) Unless the server was compiled without module support.
+      After you have finished installing the ircd, you will likey wish to import
+      your old ban files.  ircd-ratbox-3 includes a tool to manage the database.
+      importing, backing up, error checking, and reclaiming lost space are all
+      supported. For more information, run /path/to/ircd/bin/bantool with no arguments.
 
-   6. 
+      I.  import old ban configs (pretend mode):
+          /path/to/ircd/bin/bantool -i -d -p /path/to/oldircd/etc
 
-       If you wish to enable the user log, oper log, and failed oper log,
-       issue these commands at the shell prompt (in the prefix directory)
+          If everything looks good, you will want to actually let bantool do the import.
 
- $ touch logs/userlog
- $ touch logs/operlog
- $ touch logs/foperlog
+      II. import old ban configs:
+          /path/to/ircd/bin/bantool -i -d /path/to/oldircd/etc
 
-         Note: If you use different names in ircd.conf, you must 'touch' the
-         specific names.
 
-   7. 
+   3. Upgrading from another version ircd-ratbox-3.x
 
-       If you are upgrading from Hybrid 5 or Hybrid 6, the config file has
-       changed drastically...
+      IMPORTANT: EVERY TIME YOU UPGRADE ircd-ratbox-3 YOU NEED TO ISSUE THIS COMMAND.
+                 FAILURE TO DO SO CAN CAUSE YOUR IRCD TO CORE!
 
-       There is a utility to convert your old config file to the new format.
-       In prefix/bin there is something called "convertconf". Its usage is:
-       ./convertconf (old config file to convert) (converted file name)
+      I. /path/to/ircd/bin/bantool -u
 
-       Convertconf will NOT convert I: lines.  You must use "convertilines"
-       for this which contains a much superior method of conversion and
-       will group I: together under one auth {};.
 
-       Once this is done, move your new config to prefix/etc/ircd.conf and
-       EDIT IT! There are still things that need changing in the config,
-       including the fact that classes MUST be above auth/connect blocks!
 
-   8. 
-
-       If you are upgrading from Hybrid 5 or Hybrid 6, the kline file has
-       also changed...
-
-       There is a utility to convert the old kline configuration file to the
-       new format. In prefix/bin there is a program called "convertklines".
-       Its usage is: ./convertklines (old kline.conf filename) (new
-       kline.conf filename) (dline.conf filename).
-
-       Once this is done, move the new files into the prefix/etc/ directory
-       under their proper names. By default, the kline file is named
-       kline.conf and the dline file is named dline.conf.

-                                 OPENSSL NOTES
-
-   Older FreeBSD machines sometimes have the obsolete ports version of
-   OpenSSL libcrypto in /usr/local/lib. When configure is used with
-   --enable-openssl, and libintl is detected in /usr/local/lib, the
-   /usr/local/lib directory will be searched BEFORE the system /usr/lib for
-   libraries by the linker. The linker may try to link to the old
-   /usr/local/lib libcrypto instead of the system /usr/lib libcrypto. Some
-   older versions may cause error messages similar to the following:
-
- gcc -g -O2 -DIRCD_PREFIX=\"/home/wcampbel/ircd\" -Wl,-export-dynamic
- -L/usr/local/lib -o ircd blalloc.o channel.o vchannel.o class.o client.o

- /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so: undefined reference to `ERR_load_RSAREF_strings'
- /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.so: undefined reference to `RSA_PKCS1_RSAref'
- *** Error code 1
-
-   If this is the case, you may need to rerun configure without the
-   --enable-openssl option, manually edit src/Makefile and modules/Makefile
-   to put -L/usr/lib before the -L/usr/local/lib in LDFLAGS, or remove the
-   old OpenSSL from /usr/local, and recompile all applications that use
-   libcrypto to use the system one.
